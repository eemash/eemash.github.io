<h1> Who should the Timberwolves Draft on 6/25?</h1>
  <h3> We'll go through picks 1-5 and discuss who the T-Wolves should draft if they land in that spot</h3>
<div>
    <p> The T-wolves picked up Kevin Garnett after trading him for Thaddeus Young, even so, it looks like hte T-Wolves are bound for one more top 5 pick in this year's draft</p>
</div>

<h2>Pick 1</h2>
  <h4>Jahlil Okafor</h4>
    <p>Only a Freshman, Jahlil is unquestionably the top pick on more than half the NBA GM's draft boards. Already 6'10'', he's 1 of 3 players with a chance to be NCAA Player of the Year. It may not matter what Jahlil does in the tournament. He'll most likely be the #1 pick in this year's draft.</p>

<h2>Pick 2</h2>
  <h4>Myles Turner</h4>
    <p>This will not be a popular choice. Most pundits have one of two as the #2 pick.  However, the wolves need defense and once they lose Kevin Martin, they'll need scoring. As a 19 year old, Turner is already one of the best shooting big men in the country. He is 6'11'' and growing. That long wing span, together with his agility will make him an above average NBA defender. Call this the visual test, but I like Turner to be the Wolves pick at #2. </p>
